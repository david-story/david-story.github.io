### Greetings, Internet! 
Hello readers of the Internet! I am creating this post just as a formal welcome to my page, as well as testing if this Jekyll static page creation really works. 

You can find some of my projects, workshops, and other shenanigans here. I will mainly be posting projects and work related to space instrumentation (my main interest);
however, I will most likely have a slightly broad range of different electronics and software items on here as I see fit. Feel free to edit or play around with any of the
schematics, boards, APIs, software, pictures, etc that are posted here. Check out my About page too for cool pictures of different nebula, galaxies, and other celestial bodies and artifacts taken 
from my telescope.
 
For now, thank you for reading and I hope to see you here again soon!

Ad Astra,

<i>David</i>
